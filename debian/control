Description: Simple and small DynDNS client written in the C language
 With this package the user can have an Internet name for his host 
 even though he might not have a name server or a static IP. It works
 by being a client of a supposedly open name server and updating the 
 server's records when the need arise. A list of the servers that are
 supported is:
   * http://www.dyndns.org
   * http://freedns.afraid.org
   * http:// www.zoneedit.com
   * http://www.no-ip.com
   * http://www.easydns.com

   * http://www.dnsexit.com

 .
 Some of the services of these servers are free of charge.

 This is a command line tool that is written in portable ANSI C with a 
 little OS abstraction layer. It can maintain multiple host names with
 the same IP address, and has a web based IP detection which runs well
 behind a NAT router.
